# DataDrive2030 Machine Learning Competition

Welcome to the DataDrive2030 Machine Learning Competition! In this competition, your task is to leverage machine learning techniques to identify factors that contribute to better learning outcomes in children attending early learning programs in South Africa.

## Background

The Thrive by Five Index (2021) highlighted that less than half of children attending early learning programs in South Africa start school with the necessary foundation for learning. Various factors, including access to quality early learning programs, poverty, gender, malnutrition, and emotional well-being, influence a child's readiness for school. Children without a strong foundation often struggle academically, putting them at a significant disadvantage.

The index uses the Early Learning Outcomes Measure (ELOM) to assess children's development, categorizing it as "on track," "falling behind," or "falling far behind."

## Challenge

Your challenge in this competition is to analyze the provided dataset using machine learning techniques to predict a child's ELOM score based on various early learning program factors. By identifying these factors, DataDrive2030 aims to design effective interventions to support South African children's optimal development.

## About DataDrive2030

DataDrive2030, established in March 2022, is a South African-based social enterprise dedicated to improving child outcomes in the first six years of life through the collection and utilization of high-quality data. Our suite of early learning measurement tools accurately assesses developmental outcomes and the quality of early learning environments in home and program settings. These tools are digitized and designed for affordable, scalable use in all official South African languages, with built-in data quality assurance mechanisms.

Our mission is to make these tools widely accessible and ensure that the generated information is easily understandable and actionable. By leveraging data, we aim to drive tangible improvements in early childhood development services in South Africa by 2030.

## Evaluation

The error metric for this competition is the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

For each row in the dataset, your submission file should contain 17 columns: ID, ELM Score, and the top 15 predictors.

Example submission file format:

```
child_id       target   feature_1             feature_2   ...       
ID_AWX6YB4QO   56.999   child_score_item_15   child_score_item_7   ... 
ID_SPYK410VL   64.070   child_score_item_4    child_score_item_3   ...
```
